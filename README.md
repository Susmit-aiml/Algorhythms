📌 Developed as part of a Hackathon project

📌 Problem Statement

Modern lifestyles are increasingly sedentary, leading to rising health risks. While fitness trackers exist, they often suffer from:

High cost and dependency on proprietary ecosystems

Inaccurate activity classification

Limited accessibility for students and everyday users

There is a clear need for an affordable, accurate, and data-driven fitness tracking solution that can work using commonly available smartphone sensors.

💡 Our Solution

We built a Smart Fitness Tracker using MATLAB that:

Detects and classifies human activities (walking, running, stairs, sitting)

Accurately computes steps, distance, stair flights, duration, and calories

Uses accelerometer, GPS, and altitude data — no wearable device required

Provides rich visualizations and interpretable insights

This project demonstrates how signal processing + intelligent rules can replicate core features of commercial fitness trackers.

⚙️ How the Tracker Works
1️⃣ Data Capture

Smartphone sensor data (.mat files)

Accelerometer (X, Y, Z)

GPS (latitude, longitude, speed)

Altitude data

2️⃣ Signal Processing

Acceleration from all axes is converted into a single magnitude signal

Noise is reduced using smoothing techniques

Data patterns (vibrations) are extracted for activity recognition

3️⃣ Step Detection (Peak & Prominence Method)

Each footstep produces a characteristic peak in acceleration

Peak height identifies steps

Peak prominence distinguishes real steps from noise

This approach makes step counting robust and activity-aware

4️⃣ Activity Classification (Activity Fingerprinting)

Each activity has a unique fingerprint based on:

Average acceleration magnitude (intensity)

Standard deviation (shakiness)

Using these two features, the system classifies:

Walking

Running

Stair climbing

Sitting / stabilized states

This makes the model data-driven yet interpretable, without heavy ML overhead.

5️⃣ Distance Calculation (Haversine Formula)

Simple distance formulas fail due to Earth’s curvature

We use the Haversine formula to calculate real-world distance accurately

Distance is computed by summing small GPS path segments

6️⃣ Stair Climb Detection

Based on altitude gain

One flight counted per 3 meters (10 feet) of sustained elevation

Smart logic ignores small hills and sensor noise

7️⃣ Calorie Estimation (MET-Based)

Calories are estimated using:

Detected activity type

Workout duration

User body weight

Standard MET (Metabolic Equivalent of Task) values

This is a scientifically accepted approach for calorie estimation.
